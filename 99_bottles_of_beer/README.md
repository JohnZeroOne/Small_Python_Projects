[PROJECT] 99 Bottles of Beer On the Wall Lyrics

GOAL

Create a program that prints out every line to the song "99 bottles of beer on the wall." This should be a pretty simple program, so to make it a bit harder, here are some rules to follow.

RULES

    If you are going to use a list for all of the numbers, do not manually type them all in. Instead, use a built in function.

    Besides the phrase "take one down," you may not type in any numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics.

    Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word "bottles" becomes singular.

    Put a blank line between each verse of the song.
