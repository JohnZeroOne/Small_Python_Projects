[Challenge] Count and Fix Green Eggs and Ham

Some of you may remember the Dr. Sues story "Green Eggs and Ham". For those of you that don't remember it or have never heard of it, here is the story https://pastebin.com/XMY48CnN. However, there is a problem with the story I gave you - every time the word I is used, it is lowercase.

Because of this problem, your job is to do the following...

    Copy the story I gave you into a regular text file.

    Create a program that reads through the story and makes the letter i uppercase any time it should be. (Make sure to change it when it's used in sam-I-am's name too.)

    Have your program make a new file, and have it write out the story correctly.

    Print out how many errors were corrected.

When you're finished, you should have corrected 70 errors.
