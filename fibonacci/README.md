[FUNCTION]Fibonacci Sequence

BACKGROUND INFORMATION If you do not know about the Fibonacci Sequence, read the information on MathIsFun.com.

The Rule is xn = xn-1 + xn-2

where:

    xn is term number "n"
    xn-1 is the previous term (n-1)
    xn-2 is the term before that (n-2)


GOAL

Define a function that allows the user to find the value of the nth term in the sequence. To make sure you've written your function correctly, test the first 10 numbers of the sequence. Remember, the 0th term is 0 and the first and second term are both 1.
