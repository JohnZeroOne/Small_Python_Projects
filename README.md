# Small_Python_Projects
A collection of smaller sized Python projects I've implemented based on problem descriptions

These are all written in Python 2.5.x, I have them converted to Python 3.x.x in my other repo

To run the projects please install Python from here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/

Download the .py file from the project you want to run and open it in IDLE or the command line
