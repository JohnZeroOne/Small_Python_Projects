[Project] Hangman Game

Goal

Create a program that selects a random word and then allows the user to guess it in a game of hangman. Like the real game, there should be blank spots for each letter in the word, and a part of the body should be added each time the user guesses a letter than is not in the answer (you may choose how many wrong turns the user can make until the game ends).

Subgoals

    If the user loses, print out the word at the end of the game.

    Create a "give up" option.
