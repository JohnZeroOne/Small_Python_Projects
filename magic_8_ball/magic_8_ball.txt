[Project] Magic 8 Ball

Goal

I'm sure you've used a magic 8 ball at one point in your life. You ask it a question, turn it right side up and it gives an answer by way of a floating die with responses written on it. You can create one in python. You must:

    Allow the user to enter their question

    Display an in progress message( i.e. "thinking")

    Create 20 responses, and show a random response

    Allow the user to ask another question or quit

Bonus Using whatever module you like, add a gui. Your gui must have:

    A box for users to enter the question

    At least 4 buttons: Ask , clear(the text box), play again and quit(this must close the window)
